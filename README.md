# MachIAvelli

MachIAvelli is an application designed to assist players in optimizing their moves and strategies in the game of Machiavelli. By leveraging image recognition technology, MachIAvelli allows users to import the current state of the game board and their hand directly from a picture. The app then allows the user to pick a move strategy and provides recommendations for the optimal move, helping players make strategic decisions.

## Features

- **Image Recognition**: MachIAvelli utilizes a fine-tuned object recognition algorithm to interpret the game board and player hands from images.

- **Optimal Move Suggestions**: The application provides, from the imported game state, suggestions for the best moves, helping players make strategic decisions.

## How to Use MachIAvelli

1. **Capture Image**: Take a clear photo of the game board and your hand using your device's camera.

3. **Analysis**: MachIAvelli will analyze the imported game state, and provide optimal move suggestions.

4. **Review Suggestions**: Review the suggestions provided by the app and make informed decisions based on the analysis.
